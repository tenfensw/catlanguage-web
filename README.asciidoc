= Cat Language Translator (web UI)

This is a small web service written in Tcl and Toolatra that translates English text to Cat Language and vice versa. It uses the ``catlanguage`` library that I've posted earlier on my second GitHub account: http://github.com/RoverAMD/catlanguage-web

The main website is http://meow.roveramd.com/catlanguage/home
